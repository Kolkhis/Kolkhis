### I like Python, Go, Neovim, and long walks on the beach.

I'm a recent, self-taught developer trying to make it as a professional.

Sometimes you'll find me streaming on [twitch](https://twitch.tv/kolkhis).

I have a passion for learning new things, be it new technologies or older, well-established ones.

I really enjoy back-end development, and I'm currently learning about systems administration and Go.

Writing small utilities using Bash has become a hobby of mine, and I look forward to learning more and more with each day that passes!
