### I'm a self-taught developer, working towards a career in platform engineering.  


I have a passion for learning different technologies, both new and old.

I find back-end development very fun, and I'm currently learning about systems administration and Go.  

Writing tools using Bash and Neovim plugins with Lua have become hobbies of mine.  
I look forward to learning more and more with each day that passes!
